# FABLAB O SHANGHAI “FABO ACADEMY X CHINA”
Fablab O Shanghai “Fabo Academy X China”, is a digital manufacturing and rapid prototyping course based on MIT’s “How To Make (Almost) Anything” class (MAS.863/4.140/6.943) and Fab Foundation’s “Fab Academy” global. The course is an overview of the tools and practices commonly used in any Fablab, with a focus on design, project development and documentation.

## COURSE CONTENTS

The course is divided in two parts. The first one is focused on the tools and workflows of the Fablab: 3D scanning, electronic design and programming, basics of 2D sketching and 3D Modeling software, training on laser cutting and 3D printing. This first phase is important to learn the constraints and best practices to design objects for digital fabrication tools. Get used to move from design to prototype and back for improvements. Understand how the machines work, what they are used for and what are the materials available, how to adapt the design process to the machine or technique used. Also, production and programming techniques for electronics will be introduced.

## DESIGN THINKING

Throughout the class, students will be introduced to Design Thinking techniques. First they will conduct a research about the field their product will live in, collect data and informations, interpret the research material through visual storytelling and ideate a final project proposal. At this point they will experience how rapid prototyping works, by moving many times back and forth in both the design and fabrication stage. Design Thinking will be a short module (30 minutes) during the lecture of week 2, 3 and 5.

## MODULE 1: DESIGN FOR FABRICATION

1. 2D CAD software, design and Laser Cut a modular construction kit.
2. 3D Modeling software, design and 3D Print something that can only be 3D printed.
3. Programming: add Input & Output devices to your PCB.
4. Electronics: build a system to control a 2 axis machine with an actuator.
5. 3D Scanning: scan, modify, print and animate yourself.

In the second part of the course, all the technical and practical skills studied will be applied to the design and fabrication of a small device. At first the students discuss a final project proposal with input and output capabilities using design thinking techniques. The prototyping phase make use of project development and documentation tools, to record and publish the process, experiment results, design, code and all the material related to the final project. In the end, each student present the final project to the class.

## MODULE 2: PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

6. Final Project: design and manufacture an interactive storytelling object. (Part 1)
7. Final Project: design and manufacture an interactive storytelling object. (Part 2)
8. Final Documentation & Presentation.

## FINAL PROJECT BRIEF: MAKING AN “INTERACTIVE STORYTELLING OBJECT”.

The theme for the final project start with a simple question: “who am I?”. Each student will design and fabricate an object to describe an aspect of their life, their personality, or something peculiar about themselves. This object should be able to “tell a story” about its creator using shapes, images, sounds, colors, lights, movements, while interacting with the viewer or user.
